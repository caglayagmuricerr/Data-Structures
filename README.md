# Data Structures

<p> Data structures are the building blocks that allow data to be organized in different ways for storing and processing. A software variable can be considered a simple data structure. By using certain algorithms, data can be organized by transforming them into data models such as array, list, stack, queue, tree and graph.</p>

<p> This repo contains the codes I wrote on the subject. Since I wrote down each action (adding, deleting nodes, etc.) in detail, I divided the actions into different projects.</p>
